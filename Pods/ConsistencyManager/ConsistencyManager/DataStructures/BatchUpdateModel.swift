/**
 This model is useful if you want to batch updates to the consistency manager or listen to multiple models.
 It has 3 main use cases:

 1. Update multiple models in the consistency model at the same time.
 This will also cause listeners to only get notified once of this change which can cause better performance.
 In general, this is better than a for loop of updates.
 2. Listen to multiple models at once without an modelIdentifier.
 If you want to listen to mutliple models, you can use this API. The model will be set to nil if it is deleted.
 The batch listener uses this class, so you can look there for a sample implementation.
 3. Listen to multiple models with an modelIdentifier.
 If you use a modelIdentifier, you can have two seperate BatchUpdateModels which are kept in sync.
 This can be useful if you want to keep two different collections in sync.
