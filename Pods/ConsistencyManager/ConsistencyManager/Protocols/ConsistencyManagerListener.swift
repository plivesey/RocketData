     This function is called whenever the model has been updated by the conistency manager.

     There are a few important points:

     * This model will always be the same class as returned by current model. Sadly, the swift typing system isn't strong enough to make this a generic protocol.
     * Do NOT call any consistency manager methods from this method. You do NOT need to call listen on the new model as this is handled automatically.
     * The model will be nil if it has been deleted from the consistency manager.

     - parameter model: The new model which has been updated. If nil, it indicates the model has been deleted.
     - parameter updates: An update model which contains all the changes beteween the current model and the new model.
     - parameter context: This passes back the context which was passed to the consistency manager when the update occurred.
