/**
 This class allows you to combine multiple different listeners into one listener.

 If you have multiple consistency manager listeners that share common child models then an update to one of these child models will cause all of the
 listeners to fire. You may want to be notified only once when all of these listeners fire instead of multiple times. This class allows you to do this.
 You initialize an instance of this class with an array of listeners.
 If one or more of these listeners are updated due to a consistency manager change, then first modelUpdated will be called on all of the listeners; then,
 this class will call modelUpdated once on its delegate with a batch model representing all the models.
 This will notify you once that a change has occured.

 ### SETUP

 You should NOT call addListener on any of the listeners that you pass into this class. Instead, you should call it directly on the instance of this class.
 This causes the instance of this class to listen to each of the models of the listeners.
 Any time you manually change a model on one of the listeners, you need to call listenerHasUpdatedModel.
