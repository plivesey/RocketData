     Sometimes, the consistency manager may encounter a critical error.
     This is usually because a method implemented by your models or listeners is not implemented correctly.
     If you encounter one of these errors, the conistency manager will gracefully degrade by ignoring the change or request,
     and there is likely nothing you can do about it in your code (catching the error on a case by case basis won't help because you won't know how to handle the error).
     This method is provided as a convenience so you can log these errors and fix them.
     If you have set up the library correctly, you should never have this method called.

     This method is optional. If you don't implement it, it will do nothing.

     - parameter consistencyManager: The consistency manager with the error.
     - parameter error: An english string describing the error.
     This is useful for logging, but should NOT be shown to the user as it will not be very useful.

     These models could be child models so it's actually where the diff is taking place.
     This is mostly just useful for debugging. It will be called whenever something changes in the consistency manager.

     This method is optional. If you don't implement it, it will do nothing.
