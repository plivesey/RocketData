 This class is only used to test projections and most tests don't use this class.
 It's a projection which can be converted to ChildModel. It has the same fields, but also an additional field - `additionalData`.
 The modelIdentifier will be the same as ChildModels.
 The `mergeModel` method of this class implements this behavior.
