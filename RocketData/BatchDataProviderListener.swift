/**
 This class allows you to get a single callback whenever one or a few data providers get updated.
 First, the delegates of each of the data providers will be called.
 Then, the BatchDataProviderListenerDelegate method will be called.

 The main advantage of this class is to batch updates to these data providers.
 So if there is a change which affects data provider A and data provider B in different ways, there will still just be one callback to this listener.
 It will not call the batch data provider delegate twice for each data provider update; it will just call this delegate once.

 This is accomplished by creating a single combined model with all the data provider's models.
 This means that performance may be a bit worse since the models we're using will be larger.
 In general, you probably don't need to worry about this; it's just recommended you don't try to batch listen on every data provider in your app.
 The intended use case is when you have a view controller which has multiple data providers and wants to update in just one place.
