     MyModelClass has an initializer, but T doesn't. You can use this function to parse it assuming its a MyModelClass.

     This is paticularly useful when implementing the CacheDelegate. 
     The CacheDelegate requests a model of type T, but you actually want to provide a model of type T: MyModelClass.
     You can use this function to make that assumption (U is a specific supertype such as MyModelClass).
     
     Sadly, this does not work if U is a protocol due to a Swift bug. In this case, you'll need to optionally cast manually.
