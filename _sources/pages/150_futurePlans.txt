Future Plans
------------

  - Adding a listener functionality which allows you to listen for certain changes. For instance, you may want to listen for any new Message model with unread property equal to true that's been added. This is similar to using predicates to identify changes which haven't even happened yet.
  - Adding support for projections. We could allow two models with the same id if they provide a merge function. This could be useful if you want to have two representations of the same model with different fields.
